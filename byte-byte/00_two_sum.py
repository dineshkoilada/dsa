def pair_two_sum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Finds two numbers in a sorted array that add up to the target sum using the two-pointer technique.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers sorted in ascending order.
        target (int): The target sum to find.

    Returns:
        List[int]: 1-based indices of the two numbers whose sum is equal to target. Returns an empty list if no such pair exists.

    Example:
        >>> pair_two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)
        [1, 2]

    Time Complexity:
        O(n), where n is the number of elements in nums. Each element is visited at most once by either pointer.

    Space Complexity:
        O(1), as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.

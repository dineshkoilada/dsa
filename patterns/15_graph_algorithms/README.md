# Graph Pattern

## üéØ Introduction

Imagine a network of cities connected by roads. If you want to find the shortest route between two cities or check if there's a connection between them, you're working with a **Graph**. A graph consists of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections), and solving problems using graphs involves understanding these relationships.

The Graph Pattern is particularly useful for:
- Finding connected components
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra‚Äôs, Bellman-Ford)
- Detecting cycles in directed and undirected graphs
- Topological sorting
- Minimum spanning tree problems (Kruskal‚Äôs, Prim‚Äôs algorithms)

## üß† How to Start Thinking About Solving the Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Are you looking for the shortest path, detecting cycles, or checking connectivity?
   - Is the graph directed or undirected?

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions:**
   - Is the graph weighted or unweighted?
   - Are there any negative-weight edges?
   - Is the graph connected?

3. **Identify Clues for Using Graph Algorithms:**
   - The problem involves nodes and edges.
   - You need to analyze relationships or paths between nodes.
   - You‚Äôre asked about cycles, connectivity, or shortest paths.

4. **Predicting if Graph Is Applicable:**
   - Does the problem involve networks or relationships?
   - Are you looking for reachability, shortest paths, or connectivity?

## üèÅ Problem-Solving Template

### ‚úÖ **1. Define the Problem Clearly**
- Is the graph directed or undirected?
- Is the graph weighted or unweighted?
- Are you looking for a traversal, pathfinding, or structure detection?

### ‚úÖ **2. Ask Questions Before Defining Base Cases**
- What should be returned if the graph is empty?
- Are duplicate edges allowed?
- Can there be negative cycles?

### ‚úÖ **3. Identify Base Cases**
- The graph is empty.
- The node has no neighbors.

### ‚úÖ **4. Write Pseudo-Code for Base Cases**

```
function graphAlgorithm(graph):
    initialize data structures (visited, queue, stack, etc.)
    for each node in graph:
        if node is not visited:
            process node (DFS/BFS, etc.)
```

### ‚úÖ **5. Write the Code Skeleton**
```java
import java.util.*;

public class GraphTemplate {
    public static void traverseGraph(int n, List<List<Integer>> graph) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                bfs(i, graph, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    private static void bfs(int start, List<List<Integer>> graph, boolean[] visited) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(start);
        visited[start] = true;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int node = queue.poll();
            System.out.println("Visited node: " + node);

            for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **6. Edge Cases to Consider**
- Graph has disconnected components.
- Graph has self-loops.
- Graph contains negative-weight edges.

### ‚úÖ **7. How to Predict Time and Space Complexity**

| Operation                | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Breadth-First Search     | O(V + E)        | O(V)             |
| Depth-First Search       | O(V + E)        | O(V)             |
| Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm     | O((V + E) log V)| O(V)             |
| Bellman-Ford Algorithm   | O(V * E)        | O(V)             |
| Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm      | O(E log E)      | O(V)             |
| Prim‚Äôs Algorithm         | O((V + E) log V)| O(V)             |

**How to derive these complexities:**
- **Time Complexity:** Depends on the number of vertices `V` and edges `E`.
- **Space Complexity:** Depends on the data structures used (visited array, queue, or priority queue).

## üìö Example 1: Easy Problem - Number of Connected Components

**Problem:**
Given an undirected graph, count the number of connected components.

**Input:** `n = 5, edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]`

**Expected Output:** `2`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Build an adjacency list.
2. Use DFS to mark all nodes in the same component.
3. Count the number of times DFS starts from an unvisited node.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public class ConnectedComponents {
    public static int countComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }

        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(i, visited, graph);
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private static void dfs(int node, boolean[] visited, List<List<Integer>> graph) {
        visited[node] = true;
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) dfs(neighbor, visited, graph);
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(V + E) ‚Äî All nodes and edges are visited once.
- **Space:** O(V) ‚Äî Visited array and recursion stack.

## üìö Example 2: Medium Problem - Shortest Path in Weighted Graph (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

**Problem:**
Find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

**Input:** `n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,2,4],[1,2,1],[1,3,7],[2,4,3],[3,4,1]]`, `start = 0`

**Expected Output:** `[0, 2, 3, 9, 6]`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Build an adjacency list.
2. Use a priority queue to always expand the node with the smallest known distance.
3. Update distances for neighboring nodes.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
import java.util.*;

public class DijkstraShortestPath {
    public static int[] dijkstra(int n, int[][] edges, int start) {
        List<List<int[]>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(new int[]{edge[1], edge[2]});
        }

        int[] distances = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(distances, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        distances[start] = 0;

        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        pq.offer(new int[]{start, 0});

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = pq.poll();
            int node = current[0];
            int distance = current[1];

            if (distance > distances[node]) continue;

            for (int[] neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
                int nextNode = neighbor[0];
                int newDist = distance + neighbor[1];
                if (newDist < distances[nextNode]) {
                    distances[nextNode] = newDist;
                    pq.offer(new int[]{nextNode, newDist});
                }
            }
        }
        return distances;
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O((V + E) log V) ‚Äî Due to priority queue operations.
- **Space:** O(V) ‚Äî Distance array and priority queue.

## üìö Example 3: Hard Problem - Detect Cycle in Directed Graph

**Problem:**
Given a directed graph, detect if it contains a cycle.

**Input:** `n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]`

**Expected Output:** `true`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Use DFS with an additional recursion stack to detect back edges.
2. If a node is visited twice in the same recursion stack, a cycle exists.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public class DetectCycleDirectedGraph {
    public static boolean hasCycle(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
        }

        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        boolean[] recStack = new boolean[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (dfs(i, graph, visited, recStack)) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    private static boolean dfs(int node, List<List<Integer>> graph, boolean[] visited, boolean[] recStack) {
        if (recStack[node]) return true;
        if (visited[node]) return false;

        visited[node] = true;
        recStack[node] = true;

        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (dfs(neighbor, graph, visited, recStack)) return true;
        }
        recStack[node] = false;
        return false;
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(V + E) ‚Äî Each node and edge is processed once.
- **Space:** O(V) ‚Äî Visited and recursion stack arrays.

## üìö Key Takeaways

1. Use Graph algorithms when solving problems involving networks, connections, or paths.
2. Choose DFS for deep exploration and BFS for level-wise traversal or shortest paths in unweighted graphs.
3. For weighted shortest paths, use Dijkstra‚Äôs or Bellman-Ford algorithms depending on edge weights.
4. Detect cycles in directed graphs using DFS and a recursion stack.

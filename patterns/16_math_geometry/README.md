# Math & Geometry Pattern

## üéØ Introduction

Imagine designing a game where characters move around a grid, or calculating the area covered by different objects on a map. The **Math & Geometry Pattern** helps solve problems that involve numbers, spatial relationships, or geometric shapes.

This pattern is particularly useful for:
- Solving number theory problems (prime numbers, greatest common divisor)
- Handling coordinate systems and geometric shapes
- Calculating distances, angles, areas, and volumes
- Performing modulo operations and handling large numbers
- Working with grids, circles, rectangles, and other geometric figures

## üß† How to Start Thinking About Solving the Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Are you dealing with numerical calculations, shapes, or distances?
   - Are spatial relationships or coordinates involved?

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions:**

   - Are there symmetry properties that can simplify the problem?
   - What are the geometric constraints?

3. **Identify Clues for Using Math & Geometry:**
   - The problem involves distances, areas, or angles.
   - There‚Äôs a need for mathematical optimization.
   - Modulo operations, GCD, or primes are mentioned.

4. **Predicting if Math & Geometry Is Applicable:**
   - Does the problem involve spatial dimensions or coordinates?
   - Is there a need for precise calculations involving geometry?

## üèÅ Problem-Solving Template

### ‚úÖ **1. Define the Problem Clearly**
- Are you calculating distances, areas, or angles?
- Are you working with integers, floating points, or large numbers?

### ‚úÖ **2. Ask Questions Before Defining Base Cases**
- Should floating-point precision be considered?
- Is there symmetry in the problem?

### ‚úÖ **3. Identify Base Cases**
- Zero dimensions or coordinates.
- Undefined operations (e.g., division by zero).

### ‚úÖ **4. Write Pseudo-Code for Base Cases**

```
function calculateDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)

function isPrime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return false
    for i from 2 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return false
    return true
```

### ‚úÖ **5. Write the Code Skeleton**
```java
public class MathGeometry {
    public static double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
        return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x2 - x1, 2) + Math.pow(y2 - y1, 2));
    }

    public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **6. Edge Cases to Consider**
- Division by zero.
- Negative inputs for square roots.
- Precision errors with floating-point numbers.

### ‚úÖ **7. How to Predict Time and Space Complexity**

| Operation                  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Distance Calculation       | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Prime Number Check         | O(‚àön)           | O(1)             |
| GCD (Euclidean Algorithm)  | O(log min(a, b))| O(1)             |
| Area of Polygon            | O(n)            | O(1)             |

**How to derive these complexities:**
- **Time Complexity:** Depends on mathematical operations involved.
- **Space Complexity:** Usually constant unless working with additional data structures.

## üìö Example 1: Easy Problem - Check if a Number Is Prime

**Problem:**
Determine if a number is prime.

**Input:** `n = 17`

**Expected Output:** `true`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. A prime number is divisible only by 1 and itself.
2. Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public class PrimeCheck {
    public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(‚àön) ‚Äî Only checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
- **Space:** O(1) ‚Äî Only constant space used.

## üìö Example 2: Medium Problem - Calculate Euclidean Distance

**Problem:**
Given two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, calculate the distance between them.

**Input:** `(x1, y1) = (1, 2)`, `(x2, y2) = (4, 6)`

**Expected Output:** `5.0`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Use the distance formula: \( \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \)

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public class EuclideanDistance {
    public static double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
        return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x2 - x1, 2) + Math.pow(y2 - y1, 2));
    }
}
```

## üìö Example 3: Hard Problem - Area of a Polygon

**Problem:**
Find the area of a polygon given its vertices in order.

**Input:**
```
points = [
    (0, 0),
    (4, 0),
    (4, 3),
    (0, 3)
]
```

**Expected Output:** `12.0`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Use the **Shoelace formula**:
   - \( \text{Area} = 0.5 * | \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_i * y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} * y_i) | \)
2. Close the loop by setting `x[n] = x[0]` and `y[n] = y[0]`.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public class PolygonArea {
    public static double area(int[][] points) {
        int n = points.length;
        double sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int x1 = points[i][0], y1 = points[i][1];
            int x2 = points[(i + 1) % n][0], y2 = points[(i + 1) % n][1];
            sum += (x1 * y2) - (x2 * y1);
        }
        return Math.abs(sum) / 2.0;
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(n) ‚Äî Each vertex is processed once.
- **Space:** O(1) ‚Äî Only constant space used.

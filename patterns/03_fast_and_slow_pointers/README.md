# Fast and Slow Pointers Pattern üê¢üêá

## üìå Introduction: The Power of Different Speeds

Imagine you‚Äôre running on a circular track with a friend. You both start at the same point, but you run faster than your friend. If the track loops, eventually, you‚Äôll catch up and meet again. This is the foundation of the **Fast and Slow Pointers Pattern**‚Äîalso known as the **Tortoise and Hare Algorithm**.

### üé¨ Real-World Analogies:
1. **Track Race** üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
   - Two runners (one fast, one slow) on a circular track. If there‚Äôs a loop, the fast one will lap the slow one.
2. **Clock Hands** üï∞Ô∏è
   - The minute and hour hands meet at certain times, just like pointers meeting in a cycle.
3. **Musical Chairs** üé∂ü™ë
   - Players move at different speeds around a circle; eventually, some meet at the same chair.

The fast and slow pointers technique is your secret weapon when working with:
- üîÑ Detecting cycles in linked lists
- üéØ Finding the starting point of a loop
- üèÅ Determining the middle element of a linked list
- üòä Checking if a number is a happy number (repeated sequence detection)

## üß† How to Recognize a Fast and Slow Pointers Problem

### üîç Key Pattern Recognition Signals:
1. **The "Cycle" Clue** üîÅ
   - Words like "cycle," "loop," or "repeats"
   - Example: "Detect if a linked list has a cycle"
2. **The "Midpoint" Hint** üéØ
   - Need to find the middle of a sequence efficiently
   - Example: "Find the middle node of a linked list"
3. **The "Repeated Sequence" Signal** üîÇ
   - Detecting if a process enters a loop (e.g., happy number)

### ü§î Essential Questions to Ask:
1. **Pointer Speed Questions:**
   - Should one pointer move faster than the other?
   - What happens when they meet?
2. **Content Questions:**
   - Are we looking for a cycle, a midpoint, or a starting node?
3. **Edge Case Questions:**
   - What if the input is empty or has only one element?
   - What should be returned if no cycle is detected?

### üé® Visual Problem-Solving Framework:
```
Step 1: Initialize Pointers
[üê¢][‚¨ú][‚¨ú][‚¨ú][üêá]  üëà Both at start

Step 2: Move Pointers
[‚¨ú][üê¢][‚¨ú][üêá][‚¨ú]  üëà Slow moves 1, Fast moves 2

Step 3: Check for Meeting
[‚¨ú][‚¨ú][üê¢][üêá][‚¨ú]  üëà If they meet, cycle exists

Step 4: Repeat 2-3
[‚¨ú][‚¨ú][‚¨ú][üê¢üêá][‚¨ú]  üëà Until pointers meet or fast reaches end
```

## üèÅ Problem-Solving Template

### ‚úÖ **1. Define the Problem Clearly**
- Are we detecting cycles?
- Are we looking for a specific point in a sequence (e.g., midpoint, cycle start)?

### ‚úÖ **2. Ask Questions Before Defining Base Cases**
- What should be returned if the input is empty?
- Should the function return the node where the cycle starts?

### ‚úÖ **3. Identify Base Cases**
- If the list is empty or has only one node, return immediately.

### ‚úÖ **4. Write Pseudo-Code for Base Cases**
```
function detectCycle(head):
    if head is null or head.next is null:
        return false

    slow = head
    fast = head

    while fast != null and fast.next != null:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return true

    return false
```

### ‚úÖ **5. Write the Code Skeleton**
```java
public class FastSlowPointersTemplate {
    public static boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return false;
        }

        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;

            if (slow == fast) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **6. Edge Cases to Consider**
- The linked list is empty.
- The linked list contains only one node.
- No cycle is present.

### ‚úÖ **7. How to Predict Time and Space Complexity**

| Operation                | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Detecting cycle          | O(n)            | O(1)             |
| Finding middle element   | O(n)            | O(1)             |
| Detecting loop start     | O(n)            | O(1)             |

**How to derive these complexities:**
- **Time Complexity:** Both pointers traverse the list. In the worst-case scenario, they will traverse the list length `n`.
- **Space Complexity:** Only two pointers are used, regardless of the list size.

## üìö Example 1: Easy Problem - Find Middle Node of Linked List

**Problem:**
Given a singly linked list, find its middle node.

**Input:** `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`

**Expected Output:** `3`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Initialize both `slow` and `fast` pointers at the head.
2. Move `slow` by one step and `fast` by two steps.
3. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

public class MiddleOfLinkedList {
    public static ListNode findMiddle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        return slow;
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(n) ‚Äî Every node is visited once.
- **Space:** O(1) ‚Äî Only two pointers are used.

## üìö Example 2: Medium Problem - Detect a Cycle in a Linked List

**Problem:**
Given a linked list, determine if it contains a cycle.

**Input:** `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 (cycle)`

**Expected Output:** `true`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Initialize both `slow` and `fast` pointers at the head.
2. Move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps.
3. If `slow` and `fast` meet, there is a cycle.
4. If `fast` reaches the end, there‚Äôs no cycle.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public class DetectCycle {
    public static boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;

            if (slow == fast) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(n) ‚Äî Each node is visited at most twice.
- **Space:** O(1) ‚Äî Only two pointers are used.

## üìö Example 3: Hard Problem - Find the Starting Node of a Cycle

**Problem:**
Given a linked list that contains a cycle, return the node where the cycle begins.

**Input:** `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 (cycle starts at node 2)`

**Expected Output:** `2`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Use the previous cycle detection algorithm.
2. After detecting the cycle, reset one pointer to the head.
3. Move both pointers one step at a time.
4. The point where they meet is the start of the cycle.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public class CycleStartNode {
    public static ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (slow == fast) {
                ListNode entry = head;
                while (entry != slow) {
                    entry = entry.next;
                    slow = slow.next;
                }
                return entry;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(n) ‚Äî Each node is visited at most twice.
- **Space:** O(1) ‚Äî Only two pointers are used.

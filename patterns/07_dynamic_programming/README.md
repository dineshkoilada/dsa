# Dynamic Programming (DP) Pattern

## üéØ Introduction

Imagine climbing a staircase, where at each step, you can either take 1 step or 2 steps. Instead of recalculating the total ways from scratch every time, you remember previous results and build upon them. This concept of solving problems by breaking them into simpler overlapping subproblems and storing solutions is known as **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.

Dynamic Programming is particularly useful for:
- Optimization problems (finding the maximum/minimum values)
- Problems with overlapping subproblems
- Problems with optimal substructure (solutions can be built from smaller solutions)
- Counting problems (number of ways, number of paths)

## üß† How to Start Thinking About Solving the Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Can the problem be broken into smaller subproblems?
   - Do those subproblems overlap?

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions:**
   - Are you looking for the maximum, minimum, or total number of ways?
   - Is there a specific order for solving subproblems?

3. **Identify Clues for Using DP:**
   - The problem can be broken into smaller subproblems.
   - Solutions to subproblems are reused multiple times.
   - You are optimizing (maximizing/minimizing) or counting something.

4. **Predicting if DP Is Applicable:**
   - Does the problem have overlapping subproblems?
   - Does the problem have an optimal substructure?

## üèÅ Problem-Solving Template

### ‚úÖ **1. Define the Problem Clearly**
- Are you optimizing something or counting the number of ways?
- Does the solution depend on solving smaller subproblems first?

### ‚úÖ **2. Ask Questions Before Defining Base Cases**
- What should be returned for the smallest input?
- Are there any restrictions or constraints?

### ‚úÖ **3. Identify Base Cases**
- Define solutions for the simplest cases (e.g., when `n = 0` or `n = 1`).

### ‚úÖ **4. Write Pseudo-Code for Base Cases**

```
function DP(input):
    initialize dp array
    set base cases
    for i from 1 to n:
        dp[i] = combine(dp[i-1], dp[i-2], ...)
    return dp[n]
```

### ‚úÖ **5. Write the Code Skeleton**
```java
public class DPTemplate {
    public static int solveDP(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return n;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **6. Edge Cases to Consider**
- The input is zero or negative.
- The input is very large (consider memory usage).

### ‚úÖ **7. How to Predict Time and Space Complexity**

| Operation                | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Bottom-up DP             | O(n)            | O(n)             |
| Top-down DP (Memoization)| O(n)            | O(n)             |
| Space Optimized          | O(n)            | O(1)             |

**How to derive these complexities:**
- **Time Complexity:** Every subproblem is solved once.
- **Space Complexity:** Depends on whether you use a full table or optimize space using variables.

## üìö Example 1: Easy Problem - Fibonacci Sequence

**Problem:**
Find the `n`th Fibonacci number.

**Input:** `n = 5`

**Expected Output:** `5`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `n+1`.
2. Set `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[1] = 1`.
3. Use the relation `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public class FibonacciDP {
    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return n;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(n) ‚Äî Each Fibonacci number is computed once.
- **Space:** O(n) ‚Äî Array stores `n+1` elements.

## üìö Example 2: Medium Problem - Climbing Stairs

**Problem:**
You can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Find how many distinct ways you can climb to the top.

**Input:** `n = 3`

**Expected Output:** `3`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Initialize `dp` array.
2. Base cases: `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 1`.
3. Use relation `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public class ClimbingStairsDP {
    public static int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return 1;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

- **Space:** O(n) ‚Äî Array of size `n+1`.

## üìö Example 3: Hard Problem - Longest Palindromic Substring

**Problem:**
Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

**Input:** `"babad"`

**Expected Output:** `"bab"` or `"aba"`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Initialize a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` is `true` if `s[i..j]` is a palindrome.
2. Base cases: Every single character is a palindrome.
3. Check substrings of increasing lengths.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public class LongestPalindromeDP {
    public static String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[n][n];
        String result = "";

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) && (j - i < 3 || dp[i + 1][j - 1])) {
                    dp[i][j] = true;
                    if (j - i + 1 > result.length()) {
                        result = s.substring(i, j + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

1. Use Dynamic Programming for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
2. Break down problems into smaller subproblems and solve them incrementally.
3. Time and space complexity often depend on the size of the input and the dimensions of the problem.
4. Space optimization techniques can help reduce memory usage for larger problems.

# Sliding Window Pattern

## üéØ Introduction

Imagine you have a magnifying glass that reveals only a small part of a picture at a time. You slide this glass across the picture to analyze different portions of the image without looking at the whole picture at once. This concept is similar to the **Sliding Window Pattern**‚Äîyou examine a subset of data (a "window") and move it through the array or string to find solutions efficiently.

The sliding window technique is especially useful when working with:
- Subarrays or substrings
- Fixed-size sequences
- Optimizing calculations over consecutive elements
- Finding maximum/minimum values over a continuous range

## üß† How to Start Thinking About Solving the Problem

Before diving into code, take a moment to break down the problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Are we looking for the maximum or minimum of something?
   - Are we counting or summing values over a continuous range?

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions:**
   - Should the window size be fixed or variable?
   - What happens if the window size exceeds the array length?
   - Are duplicates allowed in the result?

3. **Identify Clues for Using Sliding Window:**
   - The problem involves subarrays, substrings, or consecutive elements.
   - You need to optimize performance for continuous sequences.

4. **Predicting if Sliding Window Is Applicable:**
   - Are you scanning contiguous elements?
   - Is there a fixed-length or dynamic range that you need to monitor?

## üèÅ Problem-Solving Template

### ‚úÖ **1. Define the Problem Clearly**
- Are we summing or counting values in a range?
- Should the window expand, shrink, or remain fixed?

### ‚úÖ **2. Ask Questions Before Defining Base Cases**
- What should be returned if the array is empty?
- Can the window include negative numbers?
- Are duplicate elements allowed?

### ‚úÖ **3. Identify Base Cases**
- If the array length is shorter than the window size, return an error or a default result.

### ‚úÖ **4. Write Pseudo-Code for Base Cases**

```
function solveSlidingWindow(array, k):
    if array is empty or k > array.length:
        return "Invalid input"

    maxSum = currentSum = sum of first k elements

    for i from k to array.length - 1:
        currentSum += array[i] - array[i - k]  // Slide window
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum)

    return maxSum
```

### ‚úÖ **5. Write the Code Skeleton**
```java
public class SlidingWindowTemplate {
    public static int slidingWindowExample(int[] array, int k) {
        if (array == null || array.length < k) {
            System.out.println("Invalid input.");
            return -1;
        }

        int maxSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            maxSum += array[i];
        }

        int windowSum = maxSum;
        for (int i = k; i < array.length; i++) {
            windowSum += array[i] - array[i - k];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
        }

        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **6. Edge Cases to Consider**
- The array is empty.
- The window size is larger than the array length.
- The array contains negative numbers.

### ‚úÖ **7. How to Predict Time and Space Complexity**

| Operation                   | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Initial sum calculation     | O(k)            | O(1)             |
| Sliding the window          | O(n - k)        | O(1)             |
| Total                       | O(n)            | O(1)             |

**How to derive these complexities:**
- **Time Complexity:** The loop runs `n - k` times after initially summing the first `k` elements.
- **Space Complexity:** We use a constant amount of space since we update the sum in place.

## üìö Example 1: Easy Problem - Maximum Sum of Subarray of Size K

**Problem:**
Given an array of integers and a number `k`, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `k`.

**Input:** `[2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]`, `k = 3`

**Expected Output:** `9`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements.
2. Slide the window by subtracting the element leaving the window and adding the new element.
3. Keep track of the maximum sum seen so far.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public class MaxSumSubarray {
    public static int maxSum(int[] arr, int k) {
        int maxSum = 0;
        int windowSum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            windowSum += arr[i];
        }
        maxSum = windowSum;

        for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
            windowSum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
        }

        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(n) ‚Äî Traverse the array once.
- **Space:** O(1) ‚Äî Only variables for sums are used.

## üìö Example 2: Medium Problem - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Problem:**
Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Input:** `"abcabcbb"`

**Expected Output:** `3`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Use a HashSet to track characters in the current window.
2. Expand the window by adding new characters.
3. Shrink the window when a duplicate character is found.
4. Keep track of the maximum length.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
import java.util.*;

public class LongestUniqueSubstring {
    public static int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int left = 0, maxLength = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            while (set.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
                set.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
            set.add(s.charAt(right));
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(n) ‚Äî Each character is visited at most twice.
- **Space:** O(k) ‚Äî The set holds at most `k` characters.

## üìö Example 3: Hard Problem - Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters

**Problem:**
Find the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.

**Input:** `"eceba"`

**Expected Output:** `3`

### üîë **Solution Steps**
1. Use a HashMap to store character counts.
2. Expand the window until there are more than two distinct characters.
3. Shrink the window by removing characters until there are only two distinct characters left.
4. Track the maximum length.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
import java.util.*;

public class LongestSubstringTwoDistinct {
    public static int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int left = 0, maxLength = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            char c = s.charAt(right);
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);

            while (map.size() > 2) {
                char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
                map.put(leftChar, map.get(leftChar) - 1);
                if (map.get(leftChar) == 0) {
                    map.remove(leftChar);
                }
                left++;
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Time and Space Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(n) ‚Äî Each character is visited at most twice.
- **Space:** O(1) ‚Äî At most two distinct characters are stored.

## üìö Key Takeaways

1. Use sliding windows for problems that involve consecutive elements, substrings, or subarrays.
2. Optimize time complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(n) by avoiding nested loops.
3. Manage fixed-size windows by adding and subtracting elements as the window moves.
4. For variable-size windows, expand and shrink dynamically based on problem constraints.

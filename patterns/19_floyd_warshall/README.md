# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm Pattern

## üéØ Introduction

Imagine you‚Äôre managing a network where you need to determine the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes‚Äîlike finding the shortest flight routes between every pair of cities. The **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** is an efficient dynamic programming approach for solving this problem.

The Floyd-Warshall Pattern is particularly useful for:
- Finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes
- Detecting negative cycles in a graph
- Calculating transitive closures
- Evaluating reachability between nodes in directed graphs

This algorithm works with **weighted directed graphs**, including graphs with negative edge weights (as long as there are no negative cycles).

## üß† How to Start Thinking About Solving the Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Are you looking for the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes?
   - Are negative weights present?

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions:**
   - Is the graph directed or undirected?
   - Are there negative edge weights?
   - Can the graph have negative cycles?

3. **Identify Clues for Using Floyd-Warshall:**
   - The problem requires shortest paths between **all pairs of nodes**.
   - The graph can have negative weights.
   - You need to check for negative cycles.

4. **Predicting if Floyd-Warshall Is Applicable:**
   - Does the problem involve all-pairs shortest paths?
   - Is the graph dense, meaning there are many edges?

## üèÅ Problem-Solving Template

### ‚úÖ **1. Define the Problem Clearly**
- Are there negative edges?
- Are self-loops allowed?

### ‚úÖ **2. Ask Questions Before Defining Base Cases**
- Should unreachable nodes be marked with infinity?
- What should happen if a negative cycle is detected?

### ‚úÖ **3. Identify Base Cases**
- Distance from a node to itself is 0.
- Distance between directly connected nodes is their edge weight.
- Distance between unconnected nodes is infinity.

### ‚úÖ **4. Write Pseudo-Code for Base Cases**

```
function floydWarshall(graph):
    n = number of nodes
    initialize distance matrix with graph weights
    for k from 0 to n-1:
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            for j from 0 to n-1:
                distance[i][j] = min(distance[i][j], distance[i][k] + distance[k][j])
    return distance matrix
```

### ‚úÖ **5. Write the Code Skeleton**
```java
public class FloydWarshall {
    public static void floydWarshall(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int[][] dist = new int[n][n];

        // Initialize distance matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == j) dist[i][j] = 0;
                else if (graph[i][j] != 0) dist[i][j] = graph[i][j];
                else dist[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2; // Avoid overflow
            }
        }

        // Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]) {
                        dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Print the shortest distance matrix
        printSolution(dist);
    }

    private static void printSolution(int[][] dist) {
        for (int[] row : dist) {
            for (int value : row) {
                if (value == Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2) {
                    System.out.print("INF ");
                } else {
                    System.out.print(value + " ");
                }
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **6. Edge Cases to Consider**
- Negative cycles in the graph.
- Self-loops with non-zero weights.
- Unreachable nodes.

### ‚úÖ **7. How to Predict Time and Space Complexity**

| Operation                  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Initialization             | O(n^2)          | O(n^2)           |
| All-Pairs Shortest Paths   | O(n^3)          | O(n^2)           |

**How to derive these complexities:**
- **Time Complexity:** Three nested loops over all nodes.

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            dist[i][j] = (i == j) ? 0 : (graph[i][j] != 0 ? graph[i][j] : Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2);
        }
    }

    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]) {
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (dist[i][i] < 0) return true; // Negative cycle detected
    }

    return false;
}
```

```

**Expected Output:**

2. Apply Floyd-Warshall logic for transitive closure.

### ‚úÖ **Code:**
```java
public static void transitiveClosure(int[][] graph) {
    int n = graph.length;
    boolean[][] reach = new boolean[n][n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            reach[i][j] = (graph[i][j] != 0);
        }
    }

    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                reach[i][j] = reach[i][j] || (reach[i][k] && reach[k][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Print transitive closure
    for (boolean[] row : reach) {
        for (boolean value : row) {
            System.out.print((value ? 1 : 0) + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

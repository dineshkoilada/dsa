# LeetCode Patterns Practice

## üìã Introduction

Welcome to the **LeetCode Patterns Practice** repository! This project is designed to help you master essential problem-solving patterns that frequently appear in coding interviews, especially for roles at top tech companies like Meta, Google, Netflix, and Apple.

The primary goal of this repository is to provide:
- A structured way to practice coding problems based on common patterns.
- Clear explanations and Java code solutions for each pattern.
- A beginner-friendly learning path to strengthen your understanding of algorithms and data structures (DSA).

Whether you're just starting your coding journey or sharpening your skills for technical interviews, this project will help you build confidence and improve your problem-solving abilities.

## üéØ Why Focus on Patterns?

Many coding interview questions follow common problem-solving patterns. Understanding these patterns will:
- Help you recognize problem types faster.
- Improve your efficiency in finding solutions.
- Increase your chances of success in technical interviews.

Instead of solving random problems, focusing on patterns allows you to develop a strategy that covers 80% of questions with just 20% of the effort‚Äîfollowing the Pareto principle.

## üèéÔ∏è Importance of Time Complexity and Space Complexity

In coding interviews and real-world software development, it's not just about solving the problem‚Äîit's about solving it efficiently.

**Time Complexity** refers to how the execution time of an algorithm grows relative to the input size. Writing time-efficient code helps:
- Handle large datasets effectively.
- Improve application performance.
- Meet industry standards for scalable solutions.

Common time complexities include:
- **O(1)** ‚Äì Constant time: The execution time does not depend on the input size.
- **O(log n)** ‚Äì Logarithmic time: Reduces the problem size at each step (e.g., Binary Search).
- **O(n)** ‚Äì Linear time: Grows proportionally with the input size.
- **O(n log n)** ‚Äì Linearithmic time: Often seen in efficient sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
- **O(n¬≤)** ‚Äì Quadratic time: Common in nested loops (e.g., Bubble Sort).
- **O(n¬≥)** ‚Äì Cubic time: Seen in problems with three levels of nested loops.
- **O(2^n)** ‚Äì Exponential time: Algorithms that solve all subsets of the input (e.g., Backtracking problems).
- **O(n!)** ‚Äì Factorial time: Found in permutation-based problems (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem).

**Space Complexity** measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. Optimizing space usage is essential for:
- Memory-constrained environments (like mobile devices).
- Improving application efficiency.
- Avoiding memory leaks and overflow issues.

Common space complexities:
- **O(1)** ‚Äì Constant space: Memory usage remains the same regardless of input size.
- **O(log n)** ‚Äì Logarithmic space: Often occurs with recursive algorithms that divide the input.
- **O(n)** ‚Äì Linear space: Memory usage grows proportionally with the input size.
- **O(n log n)** ‚Äì Linearithmic space: Seen in certain divide-and-conquer algorithms.
- **O(n¬≤)** ‚Äì Quadratic space: Common in problems involving 2D arrays (e.g., dynamic programming tables).

When solving problems, always consider:
- Can the algorithm be optimized to reduce time or space usage?
- Are there trade-offs between time and space efficiency?

Understanding these complexities is crucial for writing optimal code and succeeding in technical interviews.
